-Make sure you use windows operating systems and python 3.7
-Run the installer.bat before you run the program, it will install all the neccesary modules for you, make sure you added PIP to PATH
-If any installation is failed try installing it manually (it shouldnt fail)
-To read the list of commands read the commandlist.txt
-Yes you need internet connection for this program.
-You can run this program from IDLE or Terminal , no difference. If you are running it from PyCharm or similar, make sure your modules are set up.
-Browser used is vivaldi so most of commands won't work if you don't have it installed, however for future programs im thinking about leaving that as a user input choice or detecting the browser that's used as defualt. OR you can just use os.system("start <website>")
-Also the voice pack depends of your windows OS
-Thank you for using HoX programs, enjoy.
